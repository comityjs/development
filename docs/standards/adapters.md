This document defines what **adapters** are in Comity, what they are responsible for,
and how they must interact with the kernel and modules.

Adapters are intentionally **not** modules.

---

## 1. What Is an Adapter?

An adapter is a **bridge** between Comity and the outside world.

Examples:

- HTTP servers (Hono, Fastify, Fetch, Bun, Node)
- Runtimes
- Platform integrations

Adapters translate **external stimuli** into Comity primitives and back.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> Adapters adapt. They do not decide.

Adapters MUST:

- Be thin
- Be replaceable
- Be framework-specific

Adapters MUST NOT:

- Contain business logic
- Contain domain logic
- Contain module logic

---

## 3. Adapters vs Modules

| Concern            | Modules    | Adapters             |
| ------------------ | ---------- | -------------------- |
| Reusability        | High       | Low / platform-bound |
| Domain knowledge   | Yes        | No                   |
| Framework-specific | No         | Yes                  |
| Lifecycle control  | Hook-based | External             |
| Kernel dependency  | Yes        | Yes                  |

Adapters are consumers of modules, not participants.

---

## 4. Adapter Responsibilities

An adapter MAY:

- Instantiate the kernel
- Configure the kernel
- Register modules
- Translate incoming requests
- Translate outgoing results

An adapter MUST:

- Respect kernel lifecycle
- Respect module contracts
- Handle I/O and side effects

---

## 5. Adapter Boundaries

Adapters MUST NOT:

- Register kernel hooks
- Emit domain events
- Mutate module state
- Depend on internal module APIs

Adapters interact only through:

- Public facades
- Kernel APIs
- Explicit entrypoints

---

## 6. HTTP Adapters (Example)

An HTTP adapter:

- Receives a framework request
- Creates an `HttpContext`
- Invokes the HTTP facade
- Translates `HttpResult` into a framework response

Example flow:

```
Framework Request
  ↓
HttpAdapter
  ↓
HttpFacade.handle(ctx)
  ↓
HttpResult
  ↓
Framework Response
```

---

## 7. Error Handling

Adapters MUST:

- Catch errors thrown by facades
- Translate them to framework-specific responses
- Never swallow errors silently

Adapters MUST NOT:

- Invent new domain errors
- Modify error semantics
- Leak internal error details

---

## 8. Events & Observability

Adapters MAY:

- Listen to kernel events
- Listen to module events
- Emit transport-level events

Adapters MUST:

- Treat events as optional
- Avoid coupling logic to event delivery

Adapters MUST NOT:

- Rely on events for correctness

---

## 9. Adapter Packaging

Adapters SHOULD:

- Live in separate packages
- Be named explicitly

Examples:

- `@comity/http-hono`
- `@comity/graphql-client-ws`
- `@comity/router-path-to-regexp`

Adapters MUST NOT:

- Be bundled into core modules
- Be required dependencies of modules

---

## 10. Stability & Compatibility

Adapters:

- Are allowed to evolve faster than modules
- May introduce breaking changes more frequently
- MUST track compatibility with module versions

---

## 11. Integration Adapters

### Definition

An **Integration Adapter** integrates a **single external platform/system** and MAY implement contracts belonging to **multiple Core Modules**. It is distinct from a **Technology Adapter**, which binds ONE Core Module to one interchangeable technology.

### Integration Adapter vs Technology Adapter

| Concern                | Technology Adapter                                                     | Integration Adapter                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Binds                  | One Core Module                                                        | One external platform/system                         |
| Core Module contracts  | Exactly one                                                            | One or more                                          |
| Technology             | Interchangeable                                                        | Fixed by the platform                                |
| Shared platform layers | None                                                                   | Schema, mapping, normalization, filters (in-package) |
| Configuration surface  | Per contract                                                           | Unified single surface                               |
| Replaceability         | Piece-by-piece (swap technology)                                       | As a whole (swap platform)                           |
| Example                | `@comity/http-hono`, `@comity/sql-kysely`, `@comity/graphql-client-ws` | —                                                    |

The "one adapter = one Core Module" rule applies to **Technology Adapters only**.

### Qualifying Criteria

A package qualifies as an Integration Adapter ONLY when it satisfies ALL of the following criteria:

1. **Single named external platform/system** — it binds to one named platform with one primary API surface.
2. **Shared platform-specific schema/mapping/normalization** — the contracts it implements genuinely share platform-specific schema, mapping, and normalization that would otherwise be duplicated or forced into a shared package.
3. **Unified configuration surface** — one client, one endpoint, one setup module.
4. **Replaceable as a whole against another platform** — it can be replaced by another platform integration, not piece-by-piece.

If ANY criterion is not satisfied, the package MUST be modeled as one or more Technology Adapters.

### Dependency Rules

An Integration Adapter:

- MAY depend on the Core Modules whose contracts it implements;
- MAY depend on the Technology Adapters that provide the underlying technology (e.g., a GraphQL transport adapter), keeping those dependencies replaceable;
- MAY depend on `@comity/primitives` and `@comity/kernel`;
- MUST NOT depend on other Integration Adapters;
- MUST NOT depend on Application-layer code;
- MUST NOT import Core Modules beyond those whose contracts it implements and the shared helpers needed to implement them.

Example: an Integration Adapter declares `zod` as a regular dependency because the adapter validates integration runtime configuration. This is intentional and is not a peer-dependency violation.

### Public API Rules

- The root barrel exposes the concrete implementations of the Core Module contracts it satisfies.
- The root barrel MUST NOT re-export Core Module contracts — consumers import contracts from their respective Core Modules.
- Platform-specific internals (schema, mappers, normalization, filters) MUST live under `src/internal/` and MUST NOT be public.
- Public configuration MUST live under `/setup` as a single unified surface.

### Ownership

- Core Modules retain ownership of their contracts and do not know about the integration.
- The Integration Adapter owns the platform → domain mapping, the platform-specific schema/query/mapper layers, and the normalization of platform errors into Core Module error surfaces.
- The Application layer decides how to compose the integration's repositories and services.

### Lifecycle

- The Integration Adapter is initialized through the standard module setup lifecycle (`composition/setup` `module` metadata).
- Its `module` declares the Core Modules it depends on (`dependsOn`) so the kernel wires them in order.
- Its setup registers the repositories and services it owns and defines the integration's configuration hooks (`*:configuring`, `*:initialized`).

### Replaceability

Replacing a platform means replacing the Integration Adapter package and its setup, without modifying Core Modules or Application orchestration.

### Current Status

As of Phase 6.1, no Integration Adapter packages exist in the Comity monorepo. All current external integrations (storefront platforms, payment providers, CMS systems, etc.) are implemented at the Application layer by consumers. This is consistent with the qualifying criteria: no single platform integration has yet demonstrated sufficient shared schema/mapping/normalization complexity to justify a dedicated Integration Adapter package.

When a consumer integration grows to satisfy the qualifying criteria (Section 11.2), it should be extracted into a dedicated Integration Adapter package following the patterns defined here.

### GraphQL Terminology

GraphQL spans both adapter categories; the classification depends on what the package binds:

- `@comity/graphql-client` is a **Core Module**. It defines the GraphQL contracts and the `GraphqlClient` facade/abstraction, which is transport-independent.
- The concrete transport (fetch, WebSocket, ...) is provided by **Technology Adapters**, e.g. `@comity/graphql-client-ws` (WebSocket) and a fetch-based adapter (`@comity/graphql-client-fetch`) where fetch is the underlying technology.
- An Integration Adapter may use the GraphQL client and its transport adapters to integrate an external platform without becoming a Technology Adapter itself.

```text
Integration Adapter
    storefront platform integration
            │
            ├── @comity/storefront
            ├── @comity/catalog
            ├── @comity/router
            ├── @comity/cache
            └── @comity/graphql-client
                         │
                         ▼
                Technology Adapter
                (fetch / WebSocket / ...)
```

The external platform is the system being integrated; GraphQL is the protocol/API used to integrate it.

## 12. Technology Binding Dependency Policy

Technology bindings are the third-party libraries an adapter binds to (e.g. Hono, `path-to-regexp`, `kysely`, `jose`, `graphql-ws`).

Technology bindings SHOULD be declared as `peerDependencies` when:

- the consumer application controls the technology version
- duplicate runtime instances must be avoided
- the adapter only binds to the technology

Dependencies may remain regular dependencies when:

- the adapter owns the dependency lifecycle
- the dependency is an internal implementation detail

The bound technology version used for development and testing MUST also be declared as a `devDependency` so the adapter builds and its tests run in isolation.

---

## 13. Core Module peerDependency Requirement for Technology Adapters

A **Technology Adapter** binds a primary Core Module to a concrete technology. An adapter MAY depend on additional Core Modules when those dependencies are required by its implementation and are architecturally justified.

The Core Module(s) consumed by a Technology Adapter MUST be declared as `peerDependencies`.

### Rationale

When a Technology Adapter is published and consumed by an application, the application should control the Core Module version used by the adapter and the rest of the application.

Declaring the adapted Core Module as a `peerDependency`:

1. Expresses that the adapter is designed to operate against a compatible version of the Core Module supplied by the consumer.
2. Makes the Core Module part of the adapter's compatibility contract.
3. Reduces the risk of incompatible or unintended Core Module versions being introduced into the dependency graph.
4. Keeps the relationship between an Adapter and the Core Module it implements explicit in published package metadata.

### Requirement

A Technology Adapter MUST declare every Core Module it consumes as a `peerDependency`.

Core Module peer dependency ranges MUST be compatible with the versions supported by the adapter.

Inside the monorepo, `workspace:*` MAY be used for Core Module peer dependencies. The repository's publishing/release process is responsible for converting workspace ranges into appropriate published semver ranges.

### Example

For `@comity/sql-kysely`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@comity/sql": "workspace:*"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@comity/sql": "workspace:*",
    "kysely": "^0.28.0"
  }
}
```

For `@comity/http-hono`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@comity/composition": "workspace:*",
    "@comity/http": "workspace:*",
    "@comity/primitives": "workspace:*"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@comity/composition": "workspace:*",
    "@comity/http": "workspace:*",
    "@comity/primitives": "workspace:*",
    "hono": "^4.12"
  }
}
```

### Technology Dependencies

Technology/framework libraries used by an adapter MUST be declared as `peerDependencies` when the consuming application is expected to control the technology version or provide the technology implementation.

Examples include:

- Hono
- Kysely
- CASL
- Zod
- React
- Preact

This is part of the adapter's compatibility contract.

### Implementation Dependencies

Private implementation dependencies that are fully encapsulated by the adapter and are not expected to be provided or controlled by the consuming application MAY remain in `dependencies`.

The Core Module(s) adapted by the package MUST nevertheless be declared as `peerDependencies`.

An adapter MAY declare the same Core Module in both `dependencies` and `peerDependencies` when the dependency is required at runtime by the adapter while the peer declaration is also needed to express the compatibility contract with the consumer.

### Monorepo Consideration

`workspace:*` is valid for Core Module references within the monorepo.

The presence of a `workspace:*` dependency MUST NOT be considered sufficient reason to omit the corresponding `peerDependency`. Workspace resolution solves monorepo package linking; it does not replace the published package compatibility contract.

### Architectural Intent

This rule is a **packaging and compatibility rule for Technology Adapters**.

It does not change the architectural dependency direction:

```text
Application
    ↓
Adapter
    ↓
Core Module
    ↓
Kernel
```

Nor does it imply that every dependency of an Adapter must be a peer dependency. The requirement specifically applies to the Core Module(s) consumed by the adapter and to technology dependencies that are intentionally part of the consumer-controlled compatibility contract.

---

## Summary

Adapters are **edges**, not **centers**.

If a piece of code:

- Knows about frameworks → adapter
- Knows about domains → module
- Knows about execution → kernel

Keeping adapters thin is what keeps Comity portable.
