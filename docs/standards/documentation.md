This document defines the official documentation standards for Comity repositories.

All packages MUST comply with these rules. Any deviation must be intentional, explicit, and justified.

---

## Documentation Philosophy

Documentation in Comity follows these principles:

- Documentation is structural, not narrative.
- Documentation explains intent and constraints, not implementation details.
- Documentation must prevent misuse, not teach basics.
- Consistency across packages is more important than completeness.

Documentation is not a blog, not a tutorial, and not a changelog.

---

## README.md — Package Landing Page

### Purpose

Each package MUST contain a README.md in its root.

The README is a technical landing page, not full documentation.

It must allow a reader to answer in under one minute:

- What is this package?
- Why does it exist?
- What does it explicitly NOT do?
- Where do I find more information?

---

### Mandatory README Structure

Every `README.md` MUST follow this structure:

```markdown
# @comity/<package-name>

One-line description of the package purpose.

---

## Purpose

What this package does and why it exists.

---

## Scope

This package:

- ✅ does X
- ✅ does Y

This package does NOT:

- ❌ do A
- ❌ do B

---

## Public API

High-level description of the public API surface. No exhaustive reference.

---

## Documentation

- docs/overview.md
- docs/conventions.md
- docs/<other>.md

---

## Related Packages

- @comity/<related>
- @comity/<adapter>

---

## Status

Stable | Experimental | Draft
```

---

### Forbidden in `README.md`

A `README.md` MUST NOT contain:

- Installation instructions (unless strictly required).
- Long examples or tutorials.
- Architecture explanations.
- Design decisions.
- ADR references.
- Framework-specific usage.

All of the above MUST live in `docs/`.

---

### Tone of Voice Principles

1. **Authoritative, not prescriptive** — Explains what the package provides, does not prescribe how to use it
2. **3rd person and impersonal** — Never "you", "we", "our"
3. **Concise** — Every word counts
4. **Technical, not academic** — Domain terminology without unnecessary jargon
5. **Coherent** — Same style across all packages

#### Prohibited

| Incorrect                                                                              | Correct                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "You can use this package to..."                                                       | "Provides..."                 |
| "We expose lifecycle events..."                                                        | "Exposes lifecycle events..." |
| "Our approach to routing..."                                                           | ---                           |
| "This package provides HTTP contracts..." (the initial line form; this can be avoided) | "Provides HTTP contracts..."  |

#### Verbs Usage Matrix

| Priority | Verb     | Use For                         | Example                                     |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| P0       | defines  | Contracts, types, documentation | "Defines cache and store contracts"         |
| P0       | provides | Implementations, functionality  | "Provides in-memory store implementation"   |
| P0       | exposes  | Public API surface              | "Exposes lifecycle events"                  |
| P1       | offers   | Optional/opt-in features        | "Offers TTL and cache key management"       |
| P1       | encodes  | Domain concepts                 | "Encodes concepts, not implementations"     |
| P1       | manages  | State/lifecycle                 | "Manages request-scoped context"            |
| P1       | executes | Actions/behaviors               | "Executes HTTP requests through middleware" |

Avoid: handles, does, has, includes, supports, is, works, allows.

#### Scope Section Rules

- Each bullet starts with a verb
- No verb repeats more than twice in the same section
- Avoid "it" or "this package" at the start of bullets
- Pattern: `- ✅ defines cache and store contracts`
- Positive bullets cover responsibilities; negative bullets cover explicit exclusions

#### Public API Section Rules

- Group by domain, not by files or subpaths
- Use plural nouns for collections: `contracts`, `stores`, `hooks`
- Do not list files or enumerations
- Final line `No exhaustive reference; see docs for constraints.` is **MANDATORY**

#### Related Packages Section Rules

- Use em dash (—) between package and description
- Description max 5 words
- Describe the relationship type (e.g., "Kernel adapter", "Auth token integration")
- Only list packages directly related

#### Status Section Rules

- Must contain: `## Status`, a stable/experimental/draft label, review metadata
- Date in ISO format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Compliance: `Compliance: N% (Green)`
- Vocabulary: `Draft` (design incomplete or not ready for general usage), `Experimental` (usable, APIs may change without compatibility guarantees), `Stable` (public API compatibility guaranteed)
- Do not infer maturity from package version numbers

---

### Review Checklist

For each README, verify:

- ☐ No "you", "we", "our" in text
- ☐ Every sentence starts with subject + verb
- ☐ Verbs match the matrix (`defines` for contracts, `provides` for impl, etc.)
- ☐ One-line description within 10 words
- ☐ `## Scope` uses `✅` and `❌` with leading verbs
- ☐ `## Public API` describes domains, not files
- ☐ `## Related Packages` uses em dash
- ☐ `## Status` includes review metadata
- ☐ Tone is formal but accessible (no internal jargon)
- ☐ Sections match exactly the eight mandatory ones, in order

---

## Package `docs/` Directory

Each package MAY contain a `docs/` directory. If present, it MUST follow the standard structure below.

### Standard Structure

```text
docs/
├─ overview.md
├─ conventions.md
├─ architecture.md        (optional)
├─ events.md              (optional)
├─ decisions/             (optional)
```

---

### File Responsibilities

`overview.md` (REQUIRED)

Describes:

- What the module is.
- What problem it solves.
- High-level architecture and flow.

No implementation details.

---

`conventions.md` (REQUIRED)

Defines:

- Hard rules.
- Constraints.
- What is allowed and forbidden.

This file is normative.

---

`architecture.md` (OPTIONAL)

Use only if the module has multiple layers or non-trivial internal structure.

Contains diagrams and structural explanations.

---

`events.md` (OPTIONAL)

Required only for event-driven modules.

Defines:

- Event philosophy.
- Naming conventions.
- Event contracts.
- Emission rules.

---

`decisions/*.md` (OPTIONAL)

Used to document active design decisions. Package-level decisions use the ADR-style format below.

---

## Design Decisions (ADRs)

Comity documents architectural decisions as **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**.

Architecture ADRs live under `docs/standards/decisions/` and use the classic ADR format:

```text
# ADR-<NNN> — <short title>

**Status:** <Accepted | Proposed | Deprecated>

## Context
Why this decision was needed.

## Decision
What was chosen.

## Consequences
What this enables and what it forbids.

## References
Supporting documents, standards, and code paths.
```

Rules:

- One decision per file.
- ADRs represent **architectural history**: they record what was decided and why, including decisions that are later superseded.
- Historical decisions MUST remain traceable. Do not delete an accepted ADR; if a decision is overturned, record the new ADR and reference the old one.
- Corrections MUST preserve historical context: describe what existed historically and what changed, rather than rewriting the record as if the current state had always been true.
- Existing ADR references MUST NOT be removed.
- Package-level decisions MAY be documented in `packages/<name>/docs/decisions/*.md` using the same ADR-style format.

### Machine-readable ADR artifacts

ADR files use the convention `ADR-NNN-title.md` (e.g., `ADR-008-explicit-core-module-composition-exceptions.md`).

Machine-readable artifacts that serialize ADR decisions (e.g., data contracts, registers) live under `docs/standards/decisions/data/`:

```text
docs/standards/decisions/
├─ ADR-NNN-title.md
└─ data/
   └─ adr-nnn-description.ext
```

Data artifacts use the lowercase convention `adr-nnn-description.ext`, deriving their name from the ADR they serialize:

- `adr-008-core-exception-register.json`
- `adr-008-core-exception-register.schema.json`

Such artifacts are derived representations of their ADR. The ADR remains the architectural authority; a data artifact MUST NOT redefine architectural decisions.

---

## Monorepo `docs/` Directory

The monorepo root MAY contain a `docs/` directory reserved for cross-package documentation.

### Recommended Structure

```text
docs/
├─ architecture/
│  ├─ system-overview.md
│  ├─ module-boundaries.md
│
├─ standards/
│  ├─ decisions/
│  │  ├─ ADR-NNN-title.md   (architecture ADRs)
│  │  └─ data/              (machine-readable ADR artifacts)
│  ├─ documentation.md
│  ├─ events.md
│  ├─ errors.md
│
├─ glossary.md
```

---

## What Belongs Here

- Platform-wide standards.
- Cross-cutting architectural decisions.
- Naming conventions.
- Glossary and shared vocabulary.

Package-specific details MUST NOT be placed here.

---

## Markdown Rules

All documentation MUST follow these formatting rules:

Allowed:

- Standard Markdown.
- Headings and lists.
- Code blocks.

Forbidden:

- YAML frontmatter.
- Emojis in titles.
- Blog-style prose.
- Decorative formatting.

Documentation must be readable as plain text.

---

## Enforcement

- New packages MUST follow this standard.
- Existing packages SHOULD be progressively aligned.
- Code reviews MUST enforce documentation consistency.

Documentation consistency is a first-class concern.

---

## Final Note

Documentation exists to protect the architecture.

If documentation becomes unclear, verbose, or inconsistent, the architecture will follow.
